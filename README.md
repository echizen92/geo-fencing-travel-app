To integrate geo fencing into google maps api
Going to use google maps api explore how i can use the api to built this geo fencing feature into my own google maps per-se
Often when I travel overseas the journey could be quite long, the train or bus could be crowded, it could also be a challenge to view where I am based on the annoucement or info board in the train so why not I get notified when I am reaching my station.
This could be based on 1 or 2 mins before destination arrival or 500m before reaching destination maybe? But my preference would be based on time.
